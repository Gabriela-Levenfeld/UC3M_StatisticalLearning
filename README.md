# UC3M Statistical Learning

This repository contains assignments for the Statistical Learning course at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M). The aim of this projects are to apply statistical and machine learning classification tools to real world datasets

## Project 1: Statistical Learning Tools

**Goal**: To explain the main predictors affecting the output using the complete dataset.

- **Preparation**: 
  - Download data
  - Pre-process data
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Classification Modeling**: 
  - Utilization of statistical tools with an emphasis on understanding the probabilities behind predictions.
  
- **Dataset**: [Telco Customer Churn from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) 

## Project 2: Machine Learning Tools

**Goal**: To predict the output using different training/testing sets.

- **Preparation**: 
  - Download data
  - Pre-process data
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Classification Modeling**: 
  - Application of machine learning tools with an emphasis on model performance.
  
- **Dataset**: [Chronic Kidney Disease from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5G020).
